## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design 


### What I learned

In this project, i learnt how to use the picture tag and also how to use flexbox layout. i would like to understand better how to create a responsive layout using Media queries and flexbox.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_responsive.asp) - This helped me to understand how flexbox works. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
