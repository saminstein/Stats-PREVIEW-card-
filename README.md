### Built with

- flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, i learnt how to use the picture tag and also how to use flexbox layout. i would like to understand better how to create a responsive layout using Media queries and flexbox.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_responsive.asp) - This helped me to understand how flexbo works. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
